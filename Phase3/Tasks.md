# Phase 3: Defensive Strategy with Fail2Ban
## Objective
Implement and evaluate a defensive strategy that protects the victim machine (Metasploitable3) from brute-force SSH login attacks. This phase involves configuring and deploying Fail2Ban, a log-based intrusion prevention tool, to automatically detect and block repeated failed login attempts. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this defense by comparing the attack results before and after Fail2Ban is activated, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented and system security is enhanced.
